# CopperShell
A bash-like shell written in Python that supports configuration and both Windows and Linux.

Dependencies (Some may be already included in the standard Python installation):
~~colorama~~ if I return to this project, it will use a custom class with ANSI color coding.
inspect
shutil

Written in Python 3.11.5 (I now use 3.12.5 and it should work on 3.12.5)

This shell isn't meant to be something entirely serious (you can make it use a password, but it's stored in a config file in the same directory as the script!), but it is designed to be fully functional.
Run 'help' to get started.

# I HAVE NOT WORKED ON THIS PROJECT IN A WHILE.

## HEAVY WIP. Don't expect it to work out.
