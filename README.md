# CopperShell
A bash-like shell written in Python that supports configuration and both Windows and Linux.

Dependencies (Some may be already included in the standard Python installation):
colorama
inspect
shutil

Written on Python 3.11.5

This shell isn't meant to be something entirely serious (you can make it use a password, but it's stored in a config file in the same directory as the script!), but it is designed to be fully functional.
Run 'help' to get started.


## HEAVY WIP. Don't expect it to work out.
